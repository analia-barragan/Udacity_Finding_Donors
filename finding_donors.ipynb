    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to **precisely** predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classification), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Please note:** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.\n",

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records. \n",

Here for example, we are dealing with census data to predict if an individual earns more than 50.000 US dollars a year. Two of the features used to predict the income of an individual are education and work class. These two feature are probably dependent since a higher education will probably lead to an better work class, but in this model that is ignores. This also leads to this model not being able to learn interactions between features[4](#Sources). Second, is the zero frequency problem. In this case if the training data is missing a category of any categorical variable the model will assign to it a probability of zero and therefore no prediction can be made[2](#Sources). \n",

Furthermore, it is fast and simple to program requiring few settings and parameter[6](#Sources).

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the section a [Metrics and the Naïve Predictor](#Metrics-and-the-Naive-Predictor) we identified accuracy and precision as the two most relevant metrics. Therefore, the accuracy score of the testing data as well as the F$_{0.5}$ score will be the main criteria to decide which model is best for this problem. Additionally, since time is a valuable resource the training and prediction times will also be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at graph *'Accuracy Score on Testing Set'* and graph  *'F-score on Testing Set'* ' in chart *'Performance Metrics for Three Supervised Learning Models '* we can see that the AdaBoost model has the highest testing accuracy with about 86% and an F$_{0.5}$ score of about 72% in a 100% sample size. Even using smaller sample sizes of 10% and 1% the AdaBoost model's accuracy and F$_{0.5}$ are about 85%, 70% and 82%, 63% accordingly, which is higher than all other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SVM model also performs very well with a testing accuracy of about 84% and an F$_{0.5}$ score of about 67% in a 100% sample size. However, not only are the scores lower than in AdaBoost but if we look at the training and prediction times the SVM model is 2.6 times longer than the AdaBoost with a sample size of 10% and 34 times longer with a sample size of 100% in the training time and 8 times longer than the AdaBoost with a sample size of 10% and 94 times longer with a sample size of 100% in the prediction time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also the AdaBoost model performs well even with a small training set, which allows us to use our data more efficiently. Furthermore, as specified in [Question 2 - Model Application](#Question-2:-Model-Application) the AdaBoost model is simple to program and requires few parameters, which makes it easier to implement than the SVM model. Given that the data is clean and has been preprocessed to reduce noise the weaknesses of this model should not be a problem."

    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The AdaBoostClassifier is one of the most popular boosting algorithms of the ensemble methods. \n",
    "Ensemble methods are basically taking multiple models and joining them together to get a better mode. One way to do this is Boosting. In this case we focus on each models strengths and combine them to get the best result. It is as if we had a difficult math, music and history test and would ask three friends, each specialized in one of the required fields, to take the part of the test they are best at. The result would be better than if each friend takes the entire test.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the best results, the AdaBoost trains a first model to classify the data. The quality of the classification of this model is represented by a weight (positive weight for success and negative weight for no success). Once the weight for the model is calculated, all the falsely labeled data points are counted and weighted higher than the correctly labeled points. Then a second model is trained to classify the data and given the higher weight of previously misplaced data points this model concentrated on correctly classifying those data points. This model's classification quality is also measured with a weight. Again the model might make mistakes and the incorrectly classified data points get a higher weight and so the next model will concentrate on those points when trained. This is repeated with n-estimators that result in n-weights. When a new data point is provided to make a prediction each model votes on the data point \"based on whether it lies above or below the model’s threshold for its feature\"[4](#Source). All votes are aggregated and the data point is classified accordingly."

    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
