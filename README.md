# Udacity Project: Finding Donors

This is the first project of the Udacity **Intro To Machine Learning** Nanodegree. 

## Description

The goal of this project is to find donors for a fictitious charity called CharityML that provides financial support for people who want to learn Machine Learning. 


The organization determined that every donation they had came from individuals making $50k or more annually. For their next outreach they plan to send out letters only to likely donors.
The task is to identify these likely donors by evaluating and optimizing several different supervised learning algorithms and determining which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.
